{config.regulatory_context}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Answer the user's question directly and clearly
2. Use specific numbers from the member profile AND tool results
3. Refer to retirement accounts as "{config.retirement_account_term}"
4. Refer to balances as "{config.balance_term}"
5. Use simple language - no emoji or special characters
6. Format with clear sections separated by blank lines
7. Keep recommendations practical and easy to understand
8. Discuss all monetary values in {config.currency_symbol}{config.currency}

{special_instructions}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Start with a direct answer to their question.
Then explain key considerations.
End with a clear recommendation.

Use this structure for your response:

- Direct Answer: [answer their specific question]
- Key Considerations: [list 2-3 important points]
- Recommendation: [actionable advice]

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT use emoji (no emojis)
- Do NOT use special characters or symbols
- Do NOT use asterisks for emphasis
- DO separate numbers and words with spaces
- DO use simple, clear English
- DO keep sentences short
- If the user asked "How much can I withdraw?" WITHOUT specifying an amount:
  Answer generally about withdrawal rules, not specific calculations
- Only calculate specific amounts if user gave a specific amount
- Don't make up withdrawal amounts the user didn't ask about
- CRITICAL FOR AUSTRALIA: When asked about "unrestricted access" or "access without restrictions":
  Answer: "preservation age (60) upon retirement" NOT "age 65"
  Age 65 is the unrestricted non-preserved age, but unrestricted access begins at preservation age (60) upon retirement

Example format:

Answer: You can withdraw up to 100,000 {config.currency}.

Key Considerations:
- Your balance needs to last your retirement
- You have dependents to consider  
- Your other assets provide financial buffer

Recommendation: Consider withdrawing only what you need now.

USER'S EXACT QUESTION: "{user_query}"

{member_info}

{tool_status}

AI GENERATED RESPONSE (FULL {response_length} CHARACTERS - REVIEW ENTIRE RESPONSE BELOW):
{response_text}

SYSTEM NOTE:
- Off-topic queries (vacation, food, general life advice) are filtered BEFORE reaching validation using ai_classify
- If you see a polite decline for non-retirement topics, this is CORRECT behavior and should PASS
- Only retirement-related queries should have tool calculations and detailed answers

VALIDATION CRITERIA (BE FAIR - REVIEW ENTIRE RESPONSE):

0. **TOOL EXECUTION**: If ANY tools failed (see above), response MUST fail validation with CRITICAL severity

0.5. **SCOPE ADHERENCE**: 
   - If question is about retirement/pensions/superannuation → response must answer it
   - If question is OFF-TOPIC (vacation, food, general advice) → politely declining is CORRECT
   - A polite decline that redirects to retirement topics should PASS validation
   - Only fail if response answers off-topic questions OR ignores in-scope retirement questions

1. **QUESTION ANSWERING**: Does the response adequately address the user's retirement question (IF in scope)?

2. **SPECIFICITY**: Does it provide specific numbers where appropriate?

3. **DATA USAGE**: Does it reference member data appropriately? (IMPORTANT: Using member's profile data is CORRECT, not an error)

4. **COMPLETENESS**: Does it address main aspects of the question?

5. **ACCURACY**: Are statements consistent with retirement rules?

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- The member profile ABOVE contains the member's actual data (age, balance, country, etc)
- The tool calculations ABOVE show the actual results from regulatory calculators
- Using this data in the response is CORRECT and EXPECTED
- If response says "you are age 52" and profile shows age=52, that's DATA USAGE, NOT INVENTION
- If response says "your balance is $X" and profile shows balance=$X, that's CORRECT, NOT MADE UP
- If response uses numbers from tool calculations, that's CORRECT, NOT INVENTED
- Only flag as "invented data" if response contains numbers/facts NOT in the member profile OR tool results

SEVERITY GUIDELINES - BE FAIR:
- CRITICAL: Only if major factual error that contradicts member's actual data OR if tools failed
- HIGH: If main retirement question completely unanswered (when it should be)
- MODERATE: If some details missing but main answer is there
- LOW: Minor style or formatting issues

RESPONSE PASSES if:
✓ All tools executed successfully (no errors)
✓ Answers the main retirement question asked (if in scope) OR politely declines if off-topic
✓ Uses member's provided profile data appropriately
✓ Uses tool calculation results appropriately
✓ Provides accurate information about retirement rules
✓ References member's age/balance when relevant
✓ Stays within retirement advisory scope

RESPONSE FAILS only if:
✗ Any calculation tools failed to execute
✗ Completely misses answering an IN-SCOPE retirement question
✗ Answers off-topic questions outside the retirement domain
✗ Contains major factual errors about retirement rules
✗ Uses data that contradicts the provided member profile or tool results

CRITICAL: If the response passes all criteria, the "violations" array MUST be empty [].
Only include violations if the response actually FAILS validation.
Keep violations to a MAXIMUM of 2-3 significant issues.

JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS - KEEP CONCISE:
- Each violation "detail" must be ONE SENTENCE MAX
- Each violation "evidence" must be ONE SHORT QUOTE MAX
- "reasoning" must be ONE SENTENCE MAX
- If passed=true, violations MUST be an empty array []

Respond with ONLY VALID, COMPLETE JSON (no other text):
