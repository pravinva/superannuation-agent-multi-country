FAIR VALIDATION TASK: Analyze this retirement advice response thoroughly.

USER'S EXACT QUESTION: "{{ user_query }}"

{{ member_info }}

{{ tool_info }}

{{ tool_status }}

AI GENERATED RESPONSE (FULL {{ response_length }} CHARACTERS - REVIEW ENTIRE RESPONSE BELOW):
{{ response_text }}

SYSTEM NOTE:
- Off-topic queries (vacation, food, general life advice) are filtered BEFORE reaching validation using ai_classify
- If you see a polite decline for non-retirement topics, this is CORRECT behavior and should PASS
- Only retirement-related queries should have tool calculations and detailed answers

VALIDATION CRITERIA (BE FAIR - REVIEW ENTIRE RESPONSE):

0. **TOOL EXECUTION**: If ANY tools failed (see above), response MUST fail validation with CRITICAL severity

0.5. **SCOPE ADHERENCE**:
   - If question is about retirement/pensions/superannuation → response must answer it
   - If question is OFF-TOPIC (vacation, food, general advice) → politely declining is CORRECT
   - A polite decline that redirects to retirement topics should PASS validation
   - Only fail if response answers off-topic questions OR ignores in-scope retirement questions

1. **QUESTION ANSWERING**: Does the response adequately address the user's retirement question (IF in scope)?

2. **SPECIFICITY**: Does it provide specific numbers where appropriate?

3. **DATA USAGE**: Does it reference member data appropriately? (IMPORTANT: Using member's profile data is CORRECT, not an error)

4. **COMPLETENESS**: Does it address main aspects of the question?

5. **ACCURACY**: Are statements consistent with retirement rules?

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- The member profile ABOVE contains the member's actual data (age, balance, country, etc)
- The tool calculations ABOVE show the actual results from regulatory calculators
- Using this data in the response is CORRECT and EXPECTED
- If response says "you are age 52" and profile shows age=52, that's DATA USAGE, NOT INVENTION
- If response says "your balance is $X" and profile shows balance=$X, that's CORRECT, NOT MADE UP
- If response uses numbers from tool calculations, that's CORRECT, NOT INVENTED
- Only flag as "invented data" if response contains numbers/facts NOT in the member profile OR tool results

SEVERITY GUIDELINES - BE FAIR:
- CRITICAL: Only if major factual error that contradicts member's actual data OR if tools failed
- HIGH: If main retirement question completely unanswered (when it should be)
- MODERATE: If some details missing but main answer is there
- LOW: Minor style or formatting issues

RESPONSE PASSES if:
✓ All tools executed successfully (no errors)
✓ Answers the main retirement question asked (if in scope) OR politely declines if off-topic
✓ Uses member's provided profile data appropriately
✓ Uses tool calculation results appropriately
✓ Provides accurate information about retirement rules
✓ References member's age/balance when relevant
✓ Stays within retirement advisory scope

RESPONSE FAILS only if:
✗ Any calculation tools failed to execute
✗ Completely misses answering an IN-SCOPE retirement question
✗ Answers off-topic questions outside the retirement domain
✗ Contains major factual errors about retirement rules
✗ Uses data that contradicts the provided member profile or tool results

CRITICAL: If the response passes all criteria, the "violations" array MUST be empty [].
Only include violations if the response actually FAILS validation.
Keep violations to a MAXIMUM of 2-3 significant issues.

JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS - KEEP CONCISE:
- Each violation "detail" must be ONE SENTENCE MAX
- Each violation "evidence" must be ONE SHORT QUOTE MAX
- "reasoning" must be ONE SENTENCE MAX
- If passed=true, violations MUST be an empty array []

Respond with ONLY VALID, COMPLETE JSON (no other text):
{
  "passed": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "violations": [
    {
      "code": "SHORTCODE",
      "severity": "CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW",
      "detail": "One sentence.",
      "evidence": "Short quote."
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "One sentence explanation."
}
