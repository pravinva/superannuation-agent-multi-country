Hi {{ real_name }},

Thank you for reaching out! I noticed your question appears to be outside my expertise as it is {{ classification }}. I'm a Superannuation Advisor, and I specialize exclusively in retirement and superannuation planning.

I can help you with:
• Retirement savings (EPF, NPS, Superannuation, 401(k), Pensions)
• Withdrawal rules and eligibility
• Tax implications on retirement withdrawals
• Retirement benefit calculations
• Long-term retirement projections

Is there anything about your retirement planning I can help you with today?
